Project: INURPC.com Website Redesign + Positioning Upgrade

Goal:
Transform the existing INURPC.com site into a clear, compelling, premium presentation of our core offer:
AI-powered receptionist + lead handling system for Australian small business, running on HighLevel/LC Phone infrastructure with human hand-off.

NOTE we have white labelled high level to INURPC DIGITAL AI, so we do not want to be promoting high level we want to promote our own platform which is here app.inurpc.com

Core Objectives:

Clarify Value Proposition

Position INURPC DIGITAL AI as an operational upgrade for small business communications.

Messaging focus:

AI Receptionist answers inbound calls

Captures intent & caller details

Routes to human where necessary (SMS, email, callback, or Zoom booking)

Ensures no missed leads, no wasted calls

Explain the Workflow
Suggested simple flow diagram:
Caller → AI Receptionist → (Data extraction) → Business owner notification → Human follow-up

Notify paths:

SMS summaries

Email summaries

Tasks

Optional Zoom scheduling

Pipeline tracking

Target Audience

Australian solopreneurs + micro businesses

Tradies, health/wellness, local services, real estate, professional services

Trust & Practicality

Emphasise that this system is not a chatbot on a website but an actual phone receptionist replacement

Works with an Australian virtual number

Complies with call recording/transcription expectations

Visual & UX Changes

Mobile-first improvements

Current hero image is:

Oversized on mobile

Does not scale responsively

Please resize/replace hero graphic/frame so that:

The main subject is visible on mobile without scrolling

Typography remains above the fold

No horizontal clipping

Styling Direction

Feel: modern, trustworthy, technology-forward, not gimmicky

Color palette remains consistent with INURPC Digital (dark modern + clean accent)

Typography: professional, not playful

Copy Requirements

Clear primary headline (e.g. “Never Miss a Client Call Again”)

Subheadline explaining how AI receptionist + hand-off works

Short benefits list (bullet points)

Use cases by role/industry

FAQ section (privacy, recording, compliance)

CTA section: “Book a Demo” or “Get Connected”

Autonomy

You (Antigravity) are free to modify layout, visual framing, typography, iconography, and placement where it meaningfully upgrades UX clarity or conversion.

If an AI receptionist “explainer graphic” or diagram makes sense, generate it.

Outcome Standard:
Produce a version of INURPC.com that:

Loads and reads correctly on mobile

Immediately communicates what we sell

Differentiates from “website chatbots”

Demonstrates a real business workflow

Feels like a premium operational SaaS layer, not just a generic agency site
