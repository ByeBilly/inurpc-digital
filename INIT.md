# InurPC Digital - Project Initialization Guide

## The Vision
InurPC Digital isn't just a website; it's a conversion-optimized engine designed to sell the future of business automation. It serves two distinct purposes:
1. **The Platform**: A SaaS product (AI Employee Platform) for full-scale business operations.
2. **The Store**: A high-margin vault of digital assets (Snapshots, MP3s, Prompts).

## Strategic Copywriting Hooks
- "Make more while you work and sleep."
- "With your 24/7 365 day AI team."
- "The best platform that you could ever hope for your business to be running on."
- "Unified beats scattered."

## Key Project Files
- `index.html`: Global styles and font imports.
- `App.tsx`: Routing and Global Context providers.
- `types.ts`: Source of truth for all data models.
- `data/products.ts`: Current inventory for the asset store.
- `context/AuthContext.tsx`: Mock security and purchase tracking.
- `context/ReviewContext.tsx`: Dynamic feedback engine.

## Implementation Guidelines
- **Identity**: Always emphasize the Australian origin and dedication to service.
- **Aesthetics**: High-contrast, premium dark mode.
- **Support**: Direct all inquiries to `esupport@inurpc.com`.
